REACT_APP_BASE_URL=https://dummyapi.io/data/v1
```

### Development Server

Next step is to install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
To run the application locally:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm start`
```

## Live Demo

A live version of this app is hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) (free tier). Please note:

- The app may take several seconds to start on first use, as the server may be sleeping.
- Performance may be limited during periods of high usage.
